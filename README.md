*DESCRIPTION*:

During my internship, I was entrusted with a significant project that required me to design and simulate a fundamental 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) entirely using Verilog. The ALU needed to support essential operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and NOT. Working with a 4-bit architecture allowed me to gain a clear understanding of ALU functionality while still implementing meaningful arithmetic and logical operations. This task greatly enhanced my knowledge of digital logic design, strengthened my Verilog HDL programming skills, and familiarized me with the complete workflow of developing, testing, and verifying hardware modules through industry-standard Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools.The ALU architecture featured two 4-bit inputs, A and B, along with a 3-bit opcode to determine the operation to be executed. I assigned the opcodes as follows: 000 for addition, 001 for subtraction, 010 for AND, 011 for OR, and 100 for the NOT operation on operand A. I implemented the design using a combinational always block to ensure the output updated instantly with any variation in inputs or opcode.After completing the ALU module, I developed a comprehensive Verilog testbench. This testbench applied a wide range of input combinations, introduced appropriate delays between test cases, and allowed me to observe smooth signal transitions during simulation. For verification, I extensively utilized the EDA simulation tool, which provided advanced features such as waveform visualization, signal probing, cursor-based time measurements, and hierarchical inspection of modules.Once the Verilog files were compiled, I ran detailed simulations to observe how the ALU responded to each operation. The waveform results validated the correctness of the design: addition produced accurate 4-bit sums, subtraction generated proper binary differences, AND and OR operations delivered correct bitwise results, and the NOT function successfully inverted the bits of operand A. The EDA tool made debugging intuitive by enabling precise zooming, real-time waveform updates, and clear identification of unexpected behaviour. I captured relevant waveform screenshots and included them in my simulation report to demonstrate the functional accuracy of the ALU.Working with 4-bit signals allowed me to easily analyze binary transitions and understand how each individual bit influenced the final output. Overall, this project significantly strengthened my proficiency in Verilog coding, deepened my understanding of digital logic, and exposed me to the professional simulation and verification practices used in hardware design industries. It also improved my ability to interpret waveforms, identify logical issues, and validate circuit behaviour with confidence. Completing this ALU project was an important learning milestone during my internship, and I am truly grateful to Codtech for offering me such a valuable opportunity to learn, grow, and gain hands-on experience in digital electronics and hardware design.
